    <p>Hello everyone</p>
    <p>Thank for visiting. Great to have you here.</p>
    <p>I’m Mam. I am an experienced Thai teacher and I want to help you overcome any cultural or communication problems and experience in Thailand.</p>
    <p><strong>Are you struggling with life in Thailand?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you get bored when surrounded with Thai people and don't understand a word?</li>
      <li>Do you want to make a new Thai friend but have no idea how to start?</li>
      <li>Do you want to try new Thai dishes in local area?</li>
      <li>Have you tried to get local help from a business but don’t know how to ask for help?</li>
      <li>Upset with dual price just because they think you don’t know Thai?</li>
      <li>You have been in Thailand for long time and you still aren't confident to speak to your neighbor?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Let me help you with that!</strong></p>
    <p>My Thai lessons are focused on your lifestyle and I am flexible to fulfill your will to live a happy life in Thailand.</p>
    <p>If you are a tourist who plans to stay in Thailand for short time but still want to have successful communication, I am here fot you.</p>
    <p>If you plan to live in Thailand long term, I also provide lessons from beginner to advanced. You can have one-on-one classes that are the most successful way to begin. Or you can come with your friend or your partner to have a duo class that will provide a fun learning expirence together. I also teach big classes for families or a big group that learn Thai together.</p>
    <p>You can learn Thai from wherever you are through Skype for online classes. And if you are in Chiang Mai Thailand, you can have a private class in the area too.</p>
    <p>I will help you establish a bridge that will expose yourself to a Thai culture, a Thai method of thinking and a Thai life.</p>
