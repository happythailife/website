How to say “I go to Bangkok by train.”

Whenever you want to explain how you go or come as a passenger you must use the word “nâng” (นั่ง) which means “to sit”. When you use “nâng” (นั่ง) as a verb it will be followed by the type of vehicle and then the direction word at the end.

## Structure:

(Subject) + “nâng” + (Vehicle) + “pai” + (Place/Activity)

## For example:

I go to Bangkok by train.

chǎn nâng rót-fai pai Krung-thêp

ฉัน นั่ง รถไฟ ไป กรุงเทพฯ

I go to work by taxi.

chǎn nâng taxi pai tham-ngaan

ฉัน นั่ง แท็กซี่ ไป ทำงาน

“pai” (ไป) means to go (away from speaker) can be replaced by the word “maa” (มา) means to come (toward to speaker) or “klàp” (กลับ) means to go back.

If you are the driver or rider, you can use the word “khàp” (ขับ) = to drive or the word “khìi” (ขี่) = to ride instead of the word “nâng” (นั่ง)

## For example:

I drove a car to the airport by myself.

Phǒm khàp-rót maa sa-naam-bin eeng

ผม ขับ รถ มา สนามบิน เอง

He rode a bicycle home.

Khǎo khìi jàk-krà-yaan klàp bâan.

เขา ขี่ จักรยาน กลับ บ้าน
